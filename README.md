    spawnzombie 5 $row
}
```

    spawnzombie 2 3
    wait 1
}
```

### ✔ Built‑in commands

## 🔧 ModApi Features

### ✔ Cheat Command System
Register custom commands with:
- Name  
- Usage  
- Description  
- Delegate callback  

Example:

```csharp
CheatAPI.Register(
    "search",
    "search <term> — search plants and zombies",
    "Searches both PlantType and ZombieType enums.",
    delegate (string[] args)
    {
        if (args.Length < 1)
        {
            CheatConsoleLog.Warn("Usage: search <term>");
            return;
        }

        string term = args[0].ToLower();

        foreach (PlantType p in System.Enum.GetValues(typeof(PlantType)))
        {
            string name = p.ToString();
            if (name.ToLower().Contains(term))
            {
                int id = (int)p;
                CheatConsoleLog.Msg($"[{id}] {name}");
            }
        }

        foreach (ZombieType z in System.Enum.GetValues(typeof(ZombieType)))
        {
            string name = z.ToString();
            if (name.ToLower().Contains(term))
            {
                int id = (int)z;
                CheatConsoleLog.Msg($"[{id}] {name}");
            }
        }
    }
);
```
